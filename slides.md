# What is Stress?

Stress is a physiological and psychological response to external stimuli that exceeds our ability to cope.

- üß† Mental
  - pressure, conflicts
  - perfectionism, self-doubt, procrastination, overcommitment
- üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Physical
  - long hours
  - lack of sleep
  - over-training
- üåê Environmental
  - noise
  - distractions

... and that's only the tip of the iceberg

# The Root Cause of Stress

- **Disproportionate Stress Response**: <br>Stress that affects the body is usually not adequate to the situation
- **Lack of Boundaries**: <br>We don't set boundaries for ourselves and others
- **Lack of Coping Skills**: <br>We don't have the skills to deal with stress (no one learned us)
- **High-Stakes Environment** <br>Risk of big losses amplifies stress

# The Biology of Stress

### **Fight or Flight Response**

Body's extreme reactions as if every stressor is a life-or-death situation

All depends on your first experience of the similar situation.

After that, your brain will always react the same way.
It can be changed, but it's not easy.

# The Biology of Stress

## Chemical reactions: technical overview

Step by step
- **Immediate Reaction** (100 ms)
- **Release of Hormones** (500 ms)
- **Activation of the Nervous System**
- **Rationalizing the "Feelings"** based on what which hormones are released (few seconds)

Basically, it works like **Publish-Subscribe** Pattern.

# The Biology of Stress

## **Consciousness vs Subconsciousness** 
<br />

Or let's name it more accurately...

## **Human brain vs Animal brain**

# Challenging Yourself: The Emotional Gym

<br>

### **Concept of Emotional Weightlifting <br>**
The importance of voluntarily putting yourself in challenging situations.
<br>Prepare your nervous system for new challenges but in a controlled environment.


Otherwise, your animal brain will take over, and you will be in a constant stress response.

# Bonus from Dalai Lama

<i>"If a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry. <br>If it's not fixable, then there is no help in worrying. There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever."</i>
